# Sentiment Analysis Deployment using the Amazon SageMaker

# Project Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree Program where I deployed the sentiment analysis application entirely with the API gateway provided by the Amazon.

This is the final project in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program where I learnt to deployed a Sentiment Analysis Model using the Recurrent Neural Network in the AWS SageMaker. The provided notebook and the html files included in the repository use the html file as a simple web app interact with the deployed RNN model and provide the user input review either 'positive' or 'negative'.

The original code is located in the original repository <a href="https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment">Udacity SageMaker Deployment repository</a>

# Project Instruction

If you like to run this application in your computer, you can follow the step

<i> mkdir sagemaker <br>
  git clone https://github.com/rishisubedi/SageDeployment <br>
  exit </i>
  
# Result

The provided file contain .jpg file that contain the simple test of the application by using the html page. You can also try it in your own by opening the index.html page and writing your own movie review to let the application predict in your own computer.

<b> Note: The notebook file must be deployed anywhere such as Amazon Sagemaker to get fully working application </b>
