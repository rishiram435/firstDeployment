# My First Sentiment Analysis Deployment using the Amazon SageMaker

This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree Program where I deploy the sentiment analysis application entirely with the API gateway provided
by the Amazon.

The application analyze the user text through the simple web application and the model predicts whether the input 
text is negative or positive. This project use the RNN model to make prediction of the user input text.
